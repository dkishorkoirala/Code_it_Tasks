Python Looping Assignments
Focus: for, while, and nested loops
ğŸ”¹ Section A: Simple Looping Questions
1. Print Numbers from 1 to N
ğŸ”¸ Input N and print all numbers from 1 to N.
Hint: Use for i in range(1, N+1):

2. Sum of First N Natural Numbers
ğŸ”¸ Input N and print the sum 1 + 2 + ... + N.
Hint: Use a loop to add each number to a total variable.

3. Print Multiples of 3 up to N
ğŸ”¸ Input N and print all multiples of 3 up to N.
Hint: Use if i % 3 == 0: inside loop.

4. Count Digits in a Number
ğŸ”¸ Input a number and count how many digits it has.
Hint: Use while number > 0: and divide by 10 each time.

5. Reverse a Number
ğŸ”¸ Input a number, and print its reverse.
Hint: Use % 10 to get last digit, and // 10 to shorten the number.

6. Check if a Number is Prime
ğŸ”¸ Input a number and check if it's prime or not.
Hint: A number is prime if it has no divisors other than 1 and itself.

7. Find Factorial of a Number
ğŸ”¸ Input n and print n!.
Hint: Multiply all numbers from 1 to n.

8. Find All Factors of a Number
ğŸ”¸ Input a number and print all its factors.
Hint: Loop from 1 to n and check n % i == 0.

9. Sum of Digits
ğŸ”¸ Input a number and print the sum of its digits.
Hint: Use % 10 to get each digit, then // 10.

10. Check Palindrome Number
ğŸ”¸ Input a number and check if it reads the same backward.
Hint: Reverse the number and compare it with the original.
ğŸ”¹ Section B: Applied Looping Logic

11. Fibonacci Series up to N Terms
ğŸ”¸ Input N, and print the first N numbers in the Fibonacci series.
Hint: Start with 0 and 1, then update using a, b = b, a + b.

12. Find LCM of Two Numbers
ğŸ”¸ Input two numbers and find their Least Common Multiple (LCM).
Hint: Use loop starting from max(a, b) until you find a number divisible by
both.

13. Find GCD of Two Numbers
ğŸ”¸ Input two numbers and find their Greatest Common Divisor (GCD).
Hint: Loop from 1 to min(a, b) and check for common divisors.

14. Check Armstrong Number
ğŸ”¸ Input a number and check if itâ€™s an Armstrong number.
Hint: Raise each digit to the power of total digits and add them.

15. Print All Prime Numbers in a Range
ğŸ”¸ Input start and end, and print all prime numbers in that range.
Hint: Use a nested loop: outer for range, inner to check prime.

16. Find the Smallest Digit in a Number
ğŸ”¸ Input a number and print the smallest digit.
Hint: Extract each digit and compare using min.

17. Find the Largest Digit in a Number
ğŸ”¸ Input a number and print the largest digit.
Hint: Extract digits with % 10 and use max.

18. Check Perfect Number
ğŸ”¸ A number is perfect if the sum of its proper divisors equals itself.
Hint: Add all divisors (except the number) and compare with original.

19. List All Divisors of a Number
ğŸ”¸ Input a number and list all numbers that divide it.
Hint: Loop from 1 to n and check n % i == 0.

20. Find Sum of Even and Odd Digits Separately
ğŸ”¸ Input a number and calculate the sum of even digits and odd digits
separately.
Hint: Use % 10 to get each digit and separate with if digit % 2 == 0.
