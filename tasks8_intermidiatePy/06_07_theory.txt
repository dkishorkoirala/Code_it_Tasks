● Q6. What is a generator? How is it different from a
    regular function?
generators are functions that return iterators.
iterators are objects that can be iterated over.

from regular function as function are reusable blocks 
generators are once responsible to produce a sequence of values
i.e iterators

it uses yield keyword -> which not only returns a value but also pauses
till next call and next call is done using next function itself "next()"

● Q7. What are the advantages of using generators?
it is memory efficient
it is faster
load time is reduced for program
