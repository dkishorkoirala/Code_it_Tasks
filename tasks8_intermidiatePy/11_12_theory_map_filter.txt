 ● Q11. What does map() do in Python? Give an example.
-> map function applies a function to each item in an 
iterable and returns an iterator
example :
a = [1,2,3]
b = map(lambda x: x**2, a)
print(list(b))

● Q12. How is filter() different from map()?
-> filter() is used to exclude the elements from the
iterable that don't satisfy the condition
example :
a = [1,2,3]
b = filter(lambda x: x%2==0, a)
print(list(b))
