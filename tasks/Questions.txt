Python Assignment – Input & Conditional

Statements

🔹 Basic Level Questions (1–10)

1. Even or Odd

🔸 Ask the user for a number. Use the modulo operator % to check if it's

divisible by 2.

Hint: number % 2 == 0 means the number is even.

2. Positive, Negative, or Zero

🔸 Input a number and use if–elif–else to compare it with 0.

Hint: Use conditions like > 0, < 0, and == 0.

3. Largest of Two Numbers

🔸 Ask the user for two numbers and compare them using if and else.

Hint: Use if a > b: to find the larger number.

4. Check Voting Eligibility

🔸 Input age and check if it’s 18 or more.

Hint: if age >= 18:

5. Divisible by 5 and 11

🔸 Take a number and check if it's divisible by both 5 and 11.

Hint: Use if number % 5 == 0 and number % 11 == 0:

6. Leap Year Checker

🔸 Input a year and check leap year using proper conditions.

Hint: A year is leap if:

○ Divisible by 4, and not divisible by 100,

○ or divisible by 400

7. Character Type Checker

🔸 Input a single character. Use built-in string methods or ASCII ranges.

Hint: Use .isalpha(), .isdigit(), or check ASCII code with ord().

8. Uppercase or Lowercase Alphabet

🔸 Input a character and determine its case.

Hint: Use .isupper() or compare ASCII values:

○ A–Z: 65–90

○ a–z: 97–122

9. Weekday Name by Number

🔸 Input a number (1–7) and print the weekday.

Hint: Use a chain of if, elif, else statements for 1 to 7.

10. Grade Assigner

🔸 Input marks (0–100) and assign grades accordingly.

Hint: Use multiple conditions like if 90 <= marks <= 100: and so on.

Moderate Level Questions (11–20)

11. Triangle Validity Checker

🔸 Ask for three sides. A triangle is valid if sum of any two sides > third side.

Hint: Use all three combinations: a + b > c, a + c > b, b + c > a

12. Quadrant Finder

🔸 Input x and y coordinates and print which quadrant they lie in.

Hint: Use conditions like:

● x > 0 and y > 0 → 1st quadrant

● x < 0 and y > 0 → 2nd quadrant etc.

13. Odd or Even Digit Count

🔸 Input a single digit and check if it is odd or even.

Hint: Check if input is a single digit (0–9), then use % 2.

14. Electricity Bill Calculator

🔸 Use conditional blocks to calculate amount based on slab rates.

Hint: Use multiple if or if–elif–else blocks to handle each range

of units.

15. Simple Calculator

🔸 Take two numbers and an operator from user and perform calculation.

Hint: Use conditions like:

if op == '+': result = a + b and so on.

16. Absolute Value Calculator

🔸 Input a number and print its absolute value.

Hint: If number is less than 0, multiply it by -1.

17. Check if a Character is a Vowel or Consonant

🔸 Input a single alphabet and check whether it is vowel or consonant.

Hint: Use in keyword to check:

'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u' (also check uppercase)

18. Check for Triangle Type

🔸 Input three sides. Check if all equal (Equilateral), any two equal

(Isosceles), or all different (Scalene).

Hint: Use conditions like a == b and b == c, etc.

19. Check for Leap Year Using Only If (No Else)

🔸 Same as Q6, but only use if statements.

Hint: Use multiple if blocks instead of else.

20. Password Strength Checker (Simple)

🔸 Input a password and check for:

● Length >= 8

● Contains digits and letters

Hint: Use len(password), .isdigit(), .isalpha(), or loop

through characters.
